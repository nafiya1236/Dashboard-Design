# Dashboard-Design
**[Project 1:Data-Visualization-and-Storytelling](https://github.com/nafiya1236/Dashboard-Design/blob/main/sales%20analysis%20projct.pbix)**
 Sales Analysis Project Overview
I developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to analyze sales performance, profitability, customer behavior, discount impact, and time-based trends. Here's a breakdown of what I have done:

-- Data Modeling & Preparation
-Combined multiple tables (Input Data and Master Data) into a unified Sales table using Power Query.
-Removed redundant columns (e.g., Product ID) after merging for a cleaner model.
Created calculated columns:
-Total Selling Value = Quantity × Selling Price
-Total Buying Value = Quantity × Buying Price
-Created measures:
-Profit = Total Selling Value - Total Buying Value
-Profit % = (Profit / Total Buying Value) × 100

-- Visualizations Included
 used a variety of visuals to represent different aspects of the data:
Cards for KPIs:
Total Sales
Total Profit
Total Quantity
Gauge Chart:
To track performance against a target (e.g., sales/profit goals).
Matrix Table:
